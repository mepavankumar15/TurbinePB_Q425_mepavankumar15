## User Story

Its primary use case is to allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) directly on the blockchain.
A user initializes a dedicated "calculator" account that stores a value (e.g., a "result"). 
They can then send subsequent transactions to the program to modify this stored value, 
with the program ensuring the calculations are processed and the new result is saved on-chain.
